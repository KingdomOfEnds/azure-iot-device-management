# Azure IoT Device Management Sample UI

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

On October 3rd, 2016, we released an update to [the April Microsoft Azure IoT Hub device management preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-iot-hub-device-management/) to address important customer feedback. Addressing this feedback necessitated improved device twin, jobs, and queries API designs. As a result, the IoT Hub Device Management UI Sample will no longer function.

We hope to update this project soon to use the updated APIs and restore functionality of the sample.

## Update

This preconfigured solution includes device management UI components built with the latest [IoT Hub device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-management-overview) features.
